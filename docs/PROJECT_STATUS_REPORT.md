## 🏗️ The Vision
**TacTix.sol** is a high-fidelity, industrial-grade Solana trading terminal. It is designed to bridge the gap between retail-friendly interfaces and high-frequency quantitative execution. The terminal utilizes a "Cyberpunk Obsidian" aesthetic—prioritizing data density, low-latency visual feedback, and surgical precision.
