# TACTIX - Aggressive Edition (V1)

This is a specialized fork of the TACTIX frontend featuring a "Cyberpunk Aggressive" aesthetic.

## Key Design Changes
- **Void Black Backgrounds**: High contrast `#000000` base.
- **Neon Accents**: Sharper, more saturated Cyan, Pink, and Red.
- **Brutalist Geometry**: `border-radius: 0` forced globally. No soft corners.
- **Enhanced Effects**: Stronger glows and scanlines.

## Setup & Run

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Runs on **http://localhost:5174** (Port 5174 to avoid conflict with main app).

3. **Backend**:
   Connects to the same backend as the main app (localhost:5001).
